「フレンド・ファインダー」is a web app to identify how compatible you are with other people based on a simple survey.

It makes use of express, node, javascript, jquery, and of course HTML/CSS for the front end.
Users enter on a scale of 1 to 5 how they feel they relate to each question, and after submitting their choices are compared to previous users' answers and a "best friend" is given based on the difference between the two.
